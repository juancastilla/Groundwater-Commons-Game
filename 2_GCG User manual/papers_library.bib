year = {2008},
volume = {33},
number = {6},
pages = {841--867},
annote = {A well written article about a modular Kriging approach to interpolate river channel bathymetry. Introduction is well presented with a broad insight to geostatistics, which is an appropriate way to present the topic to the reader. The introduction also explains the generic problem of having discrete sampling of point locations and the need to transform these measurements into a continuous surface representation (using spatial prediction tools) for a certain application. For this purpose, there has been much attention to appropriate selection and application of these tools depending on the type/quality/arrangement/density of data. After this, a good idea is to provide an exhaustive set of fields/applications where this issue is present: temperature, rainfall, conductivity, porosity, etc. etc and end with groundwater. The article continues to describe the study site. After that there is an exhaustive review of the Kriging algorithm (maybe too much??), followed by a description of the modular approach for Kriging river channel topography. There is an interesting link or transition from the Kriging theory to identify common problems that arise when attempting accurate representations of topography from discrete/irregular data. 3 main issues are mentioned:

(1) Coordinate transformation: gain arises as a key step to implement kriging appropriately. NOTE that the procedure to define the centerline is manual and time consuming (=we are automating this part!!). Applying Kriging to meandering systems in Cartesian coordinates yields misleading results. (s,n) coordinates resolve this. 

(2) Trend: for sparse data a way to separate deterministic and stochastic components of the random function that represents the data (3D surface). The concept of separating trend from data {\&}amp; trend modeling to obtain residuals is introduced. NOTE we do something similar by manually setting the trajectory of the valley minimum + we cannot know the trends in the case of a buried fluvial system!!! It would be very hard to do so or obtain information. Maybe a process based model??? Removing trend results in a set of stationary residuals!!!

(3) Neighborhood: define to what extend data will influence a prediction. Define spatially when stationarity holds. The authors use the implementation of a search ellipse such as the one proposed by Merwade. NOTE what we are proposing is a very long-thin search ellipse??

Look at the structure of the introduction:

{\&}gt; Introduce the field of study and applications
{\&}gt; Mention the problem of discrete samples and the need for continuous surfaces for a certain objective
{\&}gt; There are many tools for this...
{\&}gt; What is done in this paper in very general terms (this sentences should probably go after!!)
{\&}gt; Briefly mention what geostatistics is about and application to environmental sciences + related work!!
{\&}gt; List of common problems, issues, limitations  {\ldots}"what we don't know"
{\&}gt; What we want to know{\ldots}what is proposed in this article
{\&}gt; How the aims described before are achieved (describe method, implement modular approach, apply to real data)

After presenting the application results, the discussion focuses on the idea that deciding what method to use and how to apply it may not be as important as the spatial arrangement of the survey data. The authors progress into testing this assumption by analysing reaches with high and low data density and by artificially "hiding" data, in this case cross-sections. One cross section was hidden and used to cross-validate predictions. This exercise showed that the results of Kriging predictions rely heavily on survey density and sampling strategy. NOTE this is a problem in the case of sparse paleochannel data and we should expect Kriging to perform poorly. 

The need for good spatial prediction is stressed at the end. The authors finally mention the possibility and benefits of embedding geomorphic knowledge concepts to geostatistical methods to meet the objectives in specific fields, such as fluvial geomorphology, etc. }

GENERAL COMMENTS

{\&}gt; Ten steps for good environmental modelling practice
{\&}gt; Guidelines for the development of models
{\&}gt; The modelling process is about:
	
	- discovering purposeful, credible models
	- from data and prior knowledge
	- in consort with end-users
	- every stage open to review and revision

_____________________________________________________________________________________
SPECIFIC COMMENTS

General areas where better modelling practice can improve models:

	{\&}gt; Proper definition of scope and objectives
	{\&}gt; Stakeholder participation
	{\&}gt; Conceptualising the system				
	{\&}gt; Alternative model families and structures 
	{\&}gt; More comprehensive testing of models
	{\&}gt; Detection and reduction of overfitting


THE TEN STEPS

1. Define the purposes for modelling

	- understanding of the system 	(often always present)
	- knowledge elicitation
	- data assessment
	- data reduction
	- focus for discussion
	- prediction
	- forecasting
	- what if
	- interpolation
	- guidance for management and decision-making


2. Specify the context: scope + resources

	- specific questions
	- interest groups
	- outputs
	- forcing variables
	- accuracy, temporal and spatial scales and resolutions
	- time frame
	- efforts and resources
	- flexibility
	- where are the boundary conditions


3. Conceptualise the system + specify data + prior knowledge

	- a block or flow diagram
	- how model drivers are linked to state variables and outputs

	- what is know of the processes: records, instrumentation, monitoring
	- begins quantitative then qualitative 
	- decide what is to be included and what can be simplified
	- level of detail
	- what are the important driver and what variables do they affect?
	- degree of aggregation: spatio-temporal resolution
	- Detail of outputs ---{\&}gt; internal resolution of the model

	- prior knowledge is known in advance
	- observational data
	- structural information
	- nature of processes
	- correlations
	- directionality of flows
	- some indication of uncertainty and parameter errors
	

4. Select model features and families

	- types of variables covered
	- white/grey/black box
	- linear/non-linear
	- stochastic/deterministic

	- functional forms of interactions
	- spatial and temporal scales of processes and their interactions
	- features sharpen the conceptualization
	- families and features often overlap
	- is a qualitative idea of behaviour required? extent of response? long- term? short-term? a trend? a distribution? spatial pattern? time series? location? 
	- make a judgement of how prominent uncertainty is likely to be ***
	- selection of model features should be flexible


5. Choose how model structure and parameter values are to be found

	- we can use science-base theoretical knowledge
	- sometimes structures can be found by trial and error
	- Parsimony!!!! (= avoid more complications than is necessary for the objective)
	- parameters: calibration by optimizing fit to observed values
	- parameters: coarse values from expert opinion or knowledge elicitation
	- often requires a lot of data even for simple models


6. Choose estimation performance criteria and technique

	- try to use several performance criteria
	- criteria: robustness to outliers, unbiasedness, statistical efficiency
	- parameter estimation algorithms have restrictive assumptions, not always realistic
	- be careful with over-parametrisation ***
	- parameters can be estimated separately for each model component
	- the parameter estimation technique should be:
			
			{\&}gt; computationally simple
			{\&}gt; robust
			{\&}gt; statistically efficient
			{\&}gt; reliable in finding the optimum
			{\&}gt; quantify uncertainty
			{\&}gt; test over-parametrisation


7. Identify model structure and parameters

	- find a suitable model for model structure and parameter values
	- test alternative model structures ***
	- see if one or more parameters can be dropped
	- statistical techniques to compare model structures: should be treated as guides
	- good structures should be consistent with prior knowledge
	- descriptors may be aggregated to make the representation more efficient


8. Verify and perform diagnostic tests

	- the model should be insensitive to small changes in the data = robust
	- the outcomes should be feasible and defensible
	- use a wide range of qualitative and quantitative criteria
	- quantitative is common, but not against many criteria
	- qualitative uses data suppliers that are non-modellers
	- it is important to check the models believability but also build the client's confidence of it


9. Quantify uncertainty

	- particularly important a...}

annote = {In this paper Merwade et. al suggest a series of GIS techniques to interpolate river bathymetry datasets and merge them with topography obtained from remote sensing. The accuracy, resolution and arrangement of these datasets are quite different, therefore specific methods are required to create appropriate river terrain models. The article first lists a series of issues related to creating river models: (1) availability of detailed data, (2) interpolation of bathymetry data and (3) integrating channel data with surrounding topography. The methodology section explains in detail 3 GIS techniques. Firstly, the use of channel fitted coordinates straighten the river, which overcomes the problems with meandering and interpolation using Euclidean distance. Second, a simple method is described consisting in generating cross sections and performing linear interpolation to obtain what the authors call "profile lines". Third, a buffer polygon is proposed for smoothing and integration of the river bathymetry to surrounding topography. The methodology is applied and cross-validated for three rivers in the United States. In all cases the modelled (interpolated) surfaces have very good correspondence with the measured data. Merwade et. al finally conclude among other things that (1) these GIS techniques solve many of the typical issues related to river terrain modelling, (2) disagreement with measured data when cross sections have different morphology or are distantly spaced, (3) the method could be computationally demanding if the number of points is large, and (4) obtaining a reasonable geomorphological model increases understanding on rival flow and hydrologic processes.

This paper is a good background source for our research in terms of general issues and methodology. In the introduction section there are good references to issues which are common to river bathymetry modelling and that are also applicable to aquifer reconstruction. Our paper will build upon some of these issues and objectives and it is a good way to create a link with existing literature. Issues indicated in (2) are particularly important to geomorphology reconstruction applications. The issues section gives very good conceptual examples of common problems encountered when interpolating sparse cross sections. Some of these shortcomings can be applied to our research problem, however hydrogeology related datasets tend to be much less dense and closely arranged. In addition, the authors provide a comprehensive list of factors (7 in total) that determine the quality of an interpolated surface. Later on in the methodology section, the concept of channel fitted coordinate transformation is explained and possible interpolators (OK, EIDW) are mentioned along with some notes of caution. The fact that search neighbourhoods can include misleading data into the model makes a simple linear interpolation procedure (only including nearest US/DS cross sections) is highly recommended. Along these lines, the proposed method to generate interim cross sections is similar to the one we are proposing but with some conceptual differences. The idea of running cross-validation by excluding some cross-sections and testing them against interpolated surfaces is recommended to test the validity of the algorithm (see related factors that are identified as relevant for the quality of interpolation). There is a brief reference on how to use 3D polygons to include the effects of braided systems and islands on the final model. This is not explained in much detail and difficult to reproduce. In the conclusions section, Merwade et.al empahize that GIS techniques used to reconstruct river bathymetry are long overdue. This can be an indication of similar issues concerning applications to geomorphology and uninformed application of common packages such as Surfer. Relevant conclusions for our research are (1), (4) and (6). The former reaffirms the benefits obtained by using (s,n) coordinates to straighten the river. Conclusion (4) applies to generating adequate models of aquifer morphology. Finally, (6) depicts a solid argument to support the development of these algorithms: in much the same way that 2D/3D models are needed for hydrodynamic processes, 3D reconstructions of aquifer geometry can be critical in some cases such as narrow incised paleochannels in water scarce regions. }

annote = {This paper depicts a very simple method to interpolate and map wetland bathymetry. Firstly, Wilcox et. al emphasise that conventional tools to carry out these tasks require vast amounts of data, but this is usually not the case for budget-restricted projects. Furthermore, they mention that mapping bathymetry is not necessarily the end goal of a study but often a key step for some other process. In this particular article the goal is to determine the approximate volume of water stored in the basin. The methodology that is presented has the following attributes: (1) minimum field time, (2) applicable to a variety of basin shapes and (3) provide reasonably accurate maps of basins. The results section shows that this technique yields very good results (24 pool basins where scrutinised). Accuracy of generated maps was tested against "unknown but constant" conditions.  Further in the results section, the authors establish that the method performs accurately considering the small amount of data collected. It is acknowledged that the interpolator was not directly tested against observed data, in turn its consistency was verified. Finally, the discussion section highlights the following elements: (1) The method is quick to implement, (2) Few data points are needed, (3) The shape and smoothness of the data influence the accuracy of calculated bathymetry, (4) the method seems to be appropriate for other applications and (5) simple and quick alternative for researchers intending to map aquatic bathymetry.

This paper is a good background source of information about the constant need for simple, quick interpolation methods under limited amounts of data. The authors develop and test a method based on very simple concepts and achieve very good accuracy. However, they fail in providing solid evidence about the actual performance against observed data. A validation dataset would have been valuable resource. In addition, this study reveals that in other related fields there is also a need for simple methods that do not require significant time inputs and computation efforts. At this point Wilcox et. al mention the importance of having a basic idea about "the deepest point and general shape of the basin". Again: Journal of Hydrology seems to be interested in this type of research most likely because of its applicability across different areas. The concept of irregularity and tortuosity of the polygonal boundary is interesting to adopt in my research. Ultimately, the simplicity and ease of computation is indicated as a positive outcome of adopting this technique.

GENERAL COMMENTS

{\&}gt; A good structure for the ABM in groundwater management review article!!!
{\&}gt; Introduction needs to be tightly written, brief, succinct and concise
{\&}gt; Tools should be viewed as alternatives, sometimes they are useful, sometimes they are not
{\&}gt; Focus towards the approach has to be unbiased = an addition to the toolkit

_____________________________________________________________________________________
SPECIFIC COMMENTS

The structure of this review article is as follows:

Section 1 - Introduction

{\&}gt; Introduces ANN in the first sentence without much preamble. 
{\&}gt; Who introduced it first and where the method lies now: one sentence
{\&}gt; Justification for the review
{\&}gt; Outline and structure 
{\&}gt; What material is going to be covered and what is expected the reader should know

Section 2 - ANN and statistics

{\&}gt; Discuss the similarities and differences between ANN and alternative approaches (here statistical methods)
{\&}gt; Where each provides value
{\&}gt; Gives a slight spin for the popularity of ANN (thus the need to review)

Sections 3 to 9 - Steps of model development and possible issues at each stage

{\&}gt; This section sets the criteria upon which the literature is going to be evaluated
{\&}gt; Some indication of good practices

Section 10 - Applications in water resources

{\&}gt; Applications in water resources are reviewed in terms of the modelling process adopted
{\&}gt; Uses the modelling steps described above as a reference
{\&}gt; This assessment is provided in several tables
{\&}gt; Some indication about the rates of publication

Section 11 - Conclusions and Recommendations

{\&}gt; Starts broad, then narrows down 
{\&}gt; Discuss the main issues, where attention is needed, what needs to be considered + some examples
{\&}gt; What needs to be changed to achieve advances in the implementation of ANNs
{\&}gt; Clearly comment advantages and disadvantages with other methods: "ANN are alternatives{\ldots}an addition to the toolkit"
{\&}gt; Sometimes works, sometimes it doesn't: identify in what cases it is useful = boundaries of applicability
{\&}gt; Where research needs to be directed = needs
{\&}gt; Provide the new research in a form that is useful to practitioners
{\&}gt; Future research

	Some useful phrases for the Conclusions and Recommendations:

	"ANN are being used increasingly{\ldots}"
	"{\ldots}the modelling process is often described poorly{\ldots}"
	"{\ldots}the main areas of concern are{\ldots}"
	"More attention needs to be paid to{\ldots}."
	"There is also a need to consider{\ldots}"
	"Examples are{\ldots}"
	"In order to achieve significant advances in the field{\ldots}"
	"ANN are alternatives{\ldots}"
	"{\ldots}an addition to the modelers toolkit{\ldots}"
	"There is a need to develop guidelines{\ldots}"
	"The primary focus should be{\ldots}."
	"Future research efforts should be directed towards{\ldots}"
	"A further challenge is the incorporation of{\ldots}."

annote = {This article by Li et.al is a review on the state of the art of spatial interpolation applied to earth and environmental sciences. Initially, the authors collect a large sample of comparative studies (53), assessing the performance of various methods/sub methods (72) for assorted types of scientific data. Subsequently, a statistical analysis is conducted to determine which are the variables that are significant for successful interpolator implementation. Their results indicate that sample density, data variation and sampling design are key parameters for model performance. OK (ordinary Kriging), IDW (inverse distance weighted) and OCK (ordinary co-Kriging) are found to be the most frequently compared interpolators, but not necessarily the most successful. Along these lines Kriging with external drift (KED) surprisingly appears with a recommendation rate of 67%. Finally, Li et.al stress that method accuracy is not only determined by the model itself but also by quality and structure of the datasets under scrutiny.

I consider that this article will be a great source of background information for my research, but not a fundamental part of it. The fact that it is a recently published review paper makes it a reliable source of comparisons and performances of available spatial interpolation methods in the context of earth sciences. The article fails in identifying which method is more effective for different types of data, an issue that can be solved by reaching each reference cited in table 3. This can be time consuming but will give a broad idea of interpolation issues encountered by other researchers. I plan to use this article to find 2-3 interpolators that are well regarded in literature and use them to benchmark my proposed paleochannel reconstruction methodology. As a result of reading this paper, potential benchmark candidates are OK, IDW, OCK, KED and RK. Further reading about these specific techniques is required.

annote = {This paper by Taylor is an invaluable resource for our research as it is an original and influential document depicting the geologic history, drainage, topography, climate and groundwater use in the Azapa Valley. The section on geology clearly explains the origin of each formation and their relative importance in terms of water yields for irrigation and human consumption. Key geologic formations are the Porphyritic (Jurassic, Cretaceous), Liparitic (Miocene) and recent Pleistocene alluvium. Understanding their geological age and typical rock components is key to understanding local hydrogeology. No other text reviewed to date provides such detailed description of the study area. Subsequently, the section that describes Pleistocene alluvium is a very good source of possible validation data for the proposed interpolation procedure. There are two figures with borehole data indicating facies and possible location of the impervious Liparitic formation which constitutes the aquifer basement surface. Furthermore, the section on chemical quality provides some additional ideas of groundwater quality dependancy on spatial location (i.e. south of arica salinity tend to be higher possibly due to contact with the Porphyritic formation). In addition, some comments on salinity at wells located north of Arica (near the coast) may be early evidence of the location of the seawater/freshwater boundary. Furthermore, the author gives some data on groundwater consumption from springs, infiltration galleries and pumping wells contemporary to the time of this study. There are figures in [L/s] that can be used as a reference of extraction rates around 1949. This may well be the earliest reference to such data in literature (more data could be found in public archives of the Chilean irrigation department or DGA). Finally the conclusion section provides some visionary comments on the prospects of groundwater availability and future water management issues in the Azapa Valley. Key conclusions to note are (1) Taylor mentions a zone of potential groundwater development of good quality/quantity north of Arica/Pago de Gomez road (this area is well developed to date???), (2) in 1949 groundwater has been fully developed by existing wells upstream of Pago de Gomez and "development of new wells could cause springs and galleries to go dry", (3) the Liparitic formation seems to be an unproductive aquifer according to deep test boreholes therefore it is not recommended to drill deeper than 50 [m], (4) large quantities of water are lost to the sea and there is potential to incorporate artificial recharge through spreading in coarse grained areas (in particular around Sorobaya) - the author recommends this alternative to be considered in the future.}

Introduce complexity only when needed!!!

Creating a comprehensive model is a difficult task. Highly multi-disciplinary!!!}

1.1 Complexity Theory

-Introduces coupled human-natural systems with complexity theory. 

1.2 ABM

-ABM is introduced as one of the main tools to understand complexity. 
-ABM originates from the object-oriented programming paradigm.
-ABM is influenced by many other disciplines: artificial life, psychology, economics, etc.
-A good reference of advantages/disadvantages of ABM.
-There is a lack of architecture/protocol development in the literature.
-Learning processes poorly represented.

1.3 Complexity research in CHANS

-Individual based modelling{\ldots}mainly ecology
-Theoretical test in social sciences{\ldots}societal patterns, behavior
-Realistic CHANS coupled with models of natural systems{\ldots}land-use, hydrology
-Several advantages of ABM make it powerful to model CHANS systems:
		
{\&}gt;power to model individual behavior
{\&}gt;capable of incorporating social {\&}amp; ecological processes
{\&}gt;possible to place agents in "real" space
{\&}gt;capacity to integrate multi-scale, multi-disciplinary knowledge

1.4 Modelling human decision making in CHANS

-Importance of human decision modelling and the effect of CHANS feedbacks
-Goal of this paper is to review how human decisions are modeled in CHANS:
	
{\&}gt;Methods
{\&}gt;Advantages/disadvantages
{\&}gt;Further work

2. METHODS

-Basically how the lit review was conducted, search terms used, papers retrieved and 	filtering process.

3. RESULTS

-Search results
-Subject fields more prone to CHANS research 
-Journals in which we find CHANS articles
-How data is collected to characterize the agents (time consuming process!!)

{\&}gt;direct observation
{\&}gt;surveys
{\&}gt;archives, reports
{\&}gt;remote sensing
{\&}gt;statistical census
{\&}gt;data sampled from statistical distributions!!
		
-Nine type of human decision models:

3.1 Microeconomic models

-Utility functions
-Role of bounded rationality
-Satisfactory vs optimal decisions
-How do we choose the utility function and its parameters??? 	
	
3.2 Space theory based models

-distance is used to estimate "attractiveness" of agents towards a certain position
-attractive areas could be environmental amenities, water bodies, coastline, etc.
-agents can communicate indirectly through a modified environment

3.3 Psychosocial and cognitive models

-cognitive maps
-agents have" abilities, desires, beliefs, learning, innovation, memory,   reputation, social norms
-fuzzy cognitive maps
-rational vs irrational decisions
-role of social networks in communication!!!

3.4 Institution-based models

-a special type of 3.3 since an institution is a social norm
-agents forced to government regulation
-taxes, subsidies, migration laws, environmental standards, etc.

3.5 Experience or preference-based decision models

-decision rules derived from quantitative/qualitative data
-stylized facts, ethnographic behavior, etc.
-simple, straightforwards, evident{\ldots}no need of extensive justification

3.6 Participatory agent-based modeling

-a special type of 3.5 where stakeholder tell the modeler how they would behave 	in different scenarios
-uses real people for collective learning
-successful approach
-reduces gap between environmental model and decision making process

3.7 Empirical or heuristic rules

-agents are assigned rules derived from empirical data or observations
-lots of processing, computation, regression, statistical analysis
-when few data is available, agents are grouped according to typology
-questions about decision making remain unanswered
-no information about motivations or expectations

3.8 Evolutionary programming

-a special type of 3.7
-agents learn and evolve as they go
-concept of chromosome, genetics, fittest individuals survive
-very good agreement with econometric models derived from real interviews

3.9 Assumption and/or calibration-base rules

-hypothetical rules
-many possible rules can be tested against real data and best fits are maintained
-difficult to obtain all the candidate set of rules
-limited number of rules can be tested against data

4. CONCLUSIONS

-paper summarizes ways of modeling human behavior in CHANS applications
-hybrid models are often employed
-models range from empirical -----{\&}gt; process based
-each have advantages/disadvantages, chosen according to context of CHANS 	application
-important to consider feedbacks!!!
-authors favor development of process-based methods as they capture micro-	level decision triggers, options and reactions
-keep it simple!!!
-maintain agents behavior limited and algorithmic, easier to defend
-lack of specific taxonomies and architectures for specific CHANS
-generic protocols need to be developed for specific research questions
-these protocols can be used as benchmar...}

annote = {This paper by Goff et.al proposes a novel spatial interpolation technique based on channel-oriented coordinate transformation. The methodology was developed as part of a study aiming to map and characterise buried channel systems in the continental shelf of Eastern United States (New Jersey). Furthermore, the authors predict that this methodology could be widely applicable in hydrology and groundwater assessments. Using high-density sea-bottom profiler datasets (chirp seismic reflection data) Goff et.al first attempt reconstruction of channel horizons using conventional interpolation methods which yields poor results. As a result, the necessity of preserving channel continuity in the longitudinal direction and cross-sectional morphology ({\textquotedblleft}u{\textquotedblright} or {\textquotedblleft}v{\textquotedblright} shaped with a minimum point) is stressed. The fact that channels meander and present sinuosity makes ordinary interpolators fail. Most of these shortcomings can be resolved by {\textquotedblleft}straightening{\textquotedblright} the meanders. This is achieved by mapping the data according to a reference frame linked to the centerline (Thalweg) of the channel. Processed results show that by applying the proposed methodology both longitudinal continuity and cross section morphology are adequately represented. However, the authors conclude that the interpolation procedure is neither automated or time efficient and the method relies heavily on efforts made to digitise channel centrelines and edges. 

This article is extremely important for my research because it is the closest piece of literature that exists to the method I will be proposing for spatial interpolation of paleoenvironments. The concept of defining {\textquotedblleft}interim{\textquotedblright} imaginary cross sections is mentioned but not fully exploited. In my research this is automated and simplified using digital image processing algorithms such as skeletonization, thus removing the need for user input. The authors mention that automation is very difficult, but digital image processing to determine the channel thalweg is an elegant solution to this problem. One major improvement that will be proposed is to generate a non-uniform interpolation grid space, as this eliminates the need of utilizing channel-transformed coordinates. As a result, computation time can be dramatically reduced. The fact that Goff et.al mention possible applications of the method to other fields makes this article a good basis for my research and a fundamental article to include within the pool of possible citations.

annote = {This paper by Merwade et.al describes and tests typical interpolation methods used for river channel bathymetry modelling, namely: IDW, OK, Topogrid, NN and Spline techniques. The authors focus on the differences in performance gained by enforcing data anisotropy before performing each interpolation. The paper first introduces the general issue of anisotropy in river channel morphology, in terms of its variability due to sinuosity along the flow direction, something not necessarily found in other types of environmental parameters (e.g. hydraulic conductivity). The motivation section emphasises the importance of developing numerical models in the field of rivers and the key factors for success: (1) generation of spatial domain (i.e. mesh) and (2) the choice of the most appropriate interpolation method. Tied to these two decisions, and essential to obtaining realistic interpolations, lies consideration and treatment of anisotropy in the data. The section on related work mentions the topic of spatial interpolation in related fields at a large scale, such as hydrology (i.e. rainfall, temperature, soil moisture, etc.) and topographic digital elevation models (DEMs). Merwade et. al then mention river bathymetry as a small scale application in hydrology. Three important references are mentioned in the context of incorporating additional knowledge to the model: (1) detrending the data (Carter and Shankar, 1997), (2) zonal IDW for estuaries (Borroughes et.al, 2001) and (3) channel-oriented curvilinear coordinate transformation (Goff and Nordfjord, 2004). The methodology section introduces 5 typical techniques used in river bathymetry modelling, including EIDW which is a modification of IDW but using an elliptical search neighbourhood in (s,n) coordinates. Model quality is obtained from the RMSE statistical metric to assess each interpolator's goodness of fit when compared to a validation dataset. Results are separated into two groups, first using non-transformed (x,y) coordinates and subsequently applying coordinate transformation to work on (s,n) coordinates. Finally, the authors discuss and conclude that enforcing anisotropy plays a major role when interpolating river channel bathymetry. In light of the results, anisotropic methods work best when enforcing anisotropic orientation through (s,n) coordinates. Surprisingly, isotropic methods outperformed all other methods in (x,y) coordinates, as anisotropic method are incapable of dealing with data arranged in a meandering planform space. 

A good paper to include in my research, especially the introduction+motivation+related work structure provides a good way to engage the reader with the topic as well as positioning the research question within the existing literature. This could be a good structure to adopt. A broader set of references to similar problems/issues in related fields would make the related work section more attractive. Methodology section is standard and presentation of the RMSE as a validity metric reinforces this structure as a good way to benchmark our proposed interpolation method. Again, the application of (s,n) becomes an important consideration which we are improving and building upon as the new algorithm achieves the same goal without the need of transforming the data to (s,n) coordinates. All the data is kept as (x,y) points in the proposed approach. There is a strong indication that interpolated surfaces improve when using anisotropic interpolation methods  + anisotropic (i.e non uniform) spatial domain. In addition, EIDW is mentioned as a promising implementation as it is quick to code and required less computation than common Kriging algorithms. This article lacks detail to possible applications to related fields and/or possibilities for future work. NOTE THAT THESE DATASETS ARE ALL DENSELY ARRANGED!!!

annote = {This article by Rathbun deals with the problem of spatial interpolation of environmental data in estuaries. Firstly, the necessity for an appropriate method to analyse data in these non-convex regions is introduced. The main issue with non-convexity is that Eucledian distance is no longer appropriate as a distance metric (a line connecting two points within the estuary can intercept land). In addition, gradients in typical estaurine datasets (salinity, DO, etc) tend to be steep. Subsequently the article introduces the need of a better distance metric: Water Distance. Then, a kriging interpolator is applied to data from Charleston Harbour with both Euclidean and Water Distance. Finally in the discussion section Rathbun argues that using a Water Distance metric solves the problem of non-convexity of the problem space. He suggests solutions to other issues such as constant values in the estuary boundaries.

This paper is a good source of background data of spatial interpolation issues in related disciplines. Some of the arguments about the need of having simple methods capable of making the best use of sparse datasets are applicable to hydrogeology. Moreover, we can argue that the problem of non-convexity can be widely found in paleoenviroments. The article fails to provide a clear idea of how to apply the interpolator due to highly technical mathematical language. No consideration of anisotropy was carried due to the spatial arrangement of spatial data (cross sections, no transects). The proposed algorithm to compute Water Distance is computer intensive: our method can significantly improve this considering how we treat the interpolation space/grid. 

Think about the audience: we should be able to explain the method clearly and succinctly so that the reader can apply it to his own data!

pages = {169--181},
month = jun,
annote = { This article deals with spatial interpolation techniques for river bathymetry data in the scope of developing appropriate datasets for 2D/3D hydrodynamic flood models. The author suggests that the use of CPU intensive anisotropic methods (i.e. anisotropic Kriging) can be matched by conventional isotropic methods (i.e. IDW, NN, OK) if trends (bed slope and cross sections) are eliminated from the data. Validation and test datasets are isolated for six river reaches in the United States. Seven interpolation techniques are applied to the test data, first including trends and consecutively removing them using three different trend exclusion functions (local Beta, local polynomial and global polynomial). Results of each trial are assessed using the RMSE, which quantifies how well the estimated elevations match measured data. This research concludes that there is a significant improvement in RMSE by removing trends and subsequently applying conventional isotropic interpolation. Results obtained by computing each interpolator against different datasets concur that this method is capable of generating surfaces that correlate better with the actual bathymetry. However, it was found that improvements rely heavily on two key factors: (1) the chosen trend function and (2) spatial arrangement of xyz data.

The present article is very useful for my research topic, as it confirms that spatial interpolation is a persistent issue in water resource investigations. On the other hand, the topic seems to be appealing to key journals in the discipline (Journal of Hydrology). The methodology used to compare the proposed method (remove trends from data) vs. traditional methods is a suitable example of how to structure such comparison. One of the main limitations of this paper is that it does not suggest alternative applications in areas such as groundwater modeling and geology, where substantial opportunities exist. This article has allowed me to identify common problems encountered both in reconstruction of river bathymetry and geomorphology of buried fluvial systems: meandering, sinuosity, spatial arrangement of data and channel coordinate conversion. In addition, the paper indirectly reveals limitations that are unique to paleoenvironment reconstruction, such as low data density and how to find a reasonable trend under geological uncertainty. In summary, this article will be critical to my research as it provides the opportunity to understand and compare spatial interpolation issues present in related fields. In addition, the author provides a good example of how to present, test and validate a new interpolation procedure. The techniques and concepts presented in this article can be adapted, improved and later translated to buried fluvial systems. As a result, the interpolation method that I am developing for paleochannel morphology can be easily applied back to river bathymetry assessments. Finally, proposing method that generates improvements in spatial analysis across different fields sets the scene for continuing work and potential citations by fellow researchers.

GENERAL COMMENTS

{\&}gt; Reviews 5 modelling approaches that have the capacity to integrate knowledge - sources, types and forms
{\&}gt; A framework to select the best approach for a given application
{\&}gt; Selection criteria based on: 

		- Purpose
		- Type of data
		- System conceptualization	
		- Treatment of entities and structures
		- Treatment of uncertainty
		- Resolving the model: scenario-based or optimization

________________________________________________________________________________________
SPECIFIC COMMENTS

{\&}gt; Introduction has a good discussion of how models are used to integrate knowledge and evaluate trade-offs

{\&}gt; Defines types of integration:

		-Integrate issues: 						economic, social, environmental
		-Integrate stakeholders: 				how connected they are to the model and relevancy of outputs
		-Integrate disciplines:	 				different disciplinary views
		-Integrate processes:					biological, chemical, physical, economic, social
		-Integrate scales of consideration: 		spatial and temporal

{\&}gt; Considerations for model choice - three questions:

		What is the purpose of the model?
		What types of data are available?
		Who are the model users? 
		What are the requirements for the scale and format of the model outputs?

		MODEL PURPOSE:

		- Prediction
		- Forecasting
		- Management and decision-making under uncertainty
		- Social learning
		- Developing system understanding, experimentation

		TYPES OF DATA

		- Quantitative:		measurable characteristics, time series, spatial or surveys
		- Qualitative:		categorical, expert opinions, stakeholder beliefs, interviews, yes/no, high/low, high/medium
		
		SYSTEM CONCEPTUALISATION

		- Treatment of space:		non-spatial, lumped spatial, region-based, grid cell or element based, continuous space
		- Treatment of time:			non-temporal (steady-state), lumped discrete temporal (transient), dynamic quasi-continuous, continuous

		TREATMENT OF ENTITIES

		- Aggregate characteristics of population
		- Individuals as agents

		TREATMENT OF UNCERTAINTY

		- Explicit treatment
		- Requires extensive testing of the model

		RESOLVING THE MODEL

		- Scenario-based
		- Optimisation


{\&}gt; SYSTEM DYNAMICS
		
	WHAT TYPES OF APPLICATION ARE THEY USED IN?		
		- used for social learning, system understating and experimentation
		
	CHARACTERISTICS
		
		- Based on differential equations. Converts a dynamic hypothesis into a "stocks and flows" representation
		- Causal relationships, feedback loops and delays are possible
	
	HOW IT DEALS WITH MODEL CONSIDERATIONS

		- discrete time
		- limited treatment of space, few spatial compartments
		- uncertainty by comprehensive testing of the model, Monte Carlo simulations, alternative model structure assumptions
		- simulation-based, what-if questions
		- often qualitative data often used, but challenging
		
	ADVANTAGES AND DISADVANTAGES

		+ feedbacks, delays and loops
		+ useful for improving system understanding, foster system thinking and knowledge integration
		+ widely accessible
		+ enriches modeling process, data collection and policy analysis

		- too many variables can be added
		- models can grow in size and complexity, elegant but less useful models
		- uncertain feedback loops can create complex behaviour not related to the real system
		- treatment of space very limited

	LIT REVIEW COMMENTS

		- broad range of applications
		- exploratory to integrated social/institutional/ecological/agricultural/physical factors
		- none investigate uncertainty in a comprehensive way
		- all focus on scenario based
		- all focus on developing system understanding
		- broad range of problems and settings


{\&}gt; BAYESIAN NETWORKS

	WHAT TYPES OF APPLICATION ARE THEY USED IN?

		- used for management and decision-making		
	CHARACTERISTICS
	
		- used in decision making and management where uncertainty is key
		- probabilistic relationships, conditional probability distribution
		- feedback loops are difficult to represent
		
	HOW IT DEALS WITH MODEL CONSIDERATIONS

		- quantitative and qualitative data
		- useful when historical data are lacking
		- good for expert opinion and survey data
		- not explicitly spatial or temporal, lumped in space and time
		- can incorporate qualitative state variables
		- outcomes include information about predictive uncertainty
		
	ADVANTAGES AND DISADVANTAGES

		+ breaks down complex causal chains into simple components
		+ integrates different sources of information
		+ less constraints about lack of data
		+ complex systems with many state variables possible

		- uncertainty in model parameters, not structure
		- needs discretization of continu...}
